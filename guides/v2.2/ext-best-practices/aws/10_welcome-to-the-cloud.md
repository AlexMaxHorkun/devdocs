# Welcome to the Cloud - an Introduction

The Cloud is farly one the most popular buzzwords at the time, right
next to Big Data, IoT or Machine Learning. This guide will give you a
quick introduction to the Cloud, demystify it and help you to understand
why it might be valuable for your own business.

If you are already familiar with general Cloud Concepts, you can skip
this Section and jump over to the Introduction of Amazon Web Servers,
terraform and the reference architecture for Magento 2.

## What is the Cloud?

So lets start at the very beginning and make it as short as we can at
the same time.

[Nick Asbury](https://sidewaysdictionary.com/#/author/sideways) wrote

To sum up. The cloud provides a new way of hosting eCommerce Systems
like Magento 2. [Michael Wittig]() and [Andreas Wittig]() wrote the
book [Amazon Web Services in Action]() and they collected a enormous
amount of benefits in their book. Summarized they say the following
about the Cloud and about AWS:

**AUTHORS NOTE** : Disclaimer here to make sure, the benefits could be
different for another public cloud provider.

- Innovative and fast-growing platform
- Services solve common problems
- Enabling automation
- Flexible capacity (scalability)
- Built for failure (reliability)
- Reducing time to market
- Benefiting from economies of scale
- Worldwide
- Professional Partner

**AUTHORS NOTE** : Ask Wittig brothers if it is possible to quote the
whole section of their book.

## How much does it cost?

As already mentioned, a Cloud gives you the opportunity to use the
resources you need at the time you'll need them. This is a significant
different between the Cloud and a classic Hosting Provider where you
are forced to buy bigger instances in case your Shop will be more
popular in the future. The cost of a Magento 2 Store running in AWS
depends on the special business needs. You will find a complete
calculation about the pricing in the section [High Level
Architecture and general Setup]().

To calculate the price of your specific setup, you can always use the
[Simply monthly Calculator](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
