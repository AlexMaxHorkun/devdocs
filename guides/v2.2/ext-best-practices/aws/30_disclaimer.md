# Disclaimer - What this Guide is not about!

The whole Magento 2 AWS with Terraform Guide is made to give an concrete
example of a Cloud Infrastructure with Magento 2. After you finished
this Guide, you should be able to type `terraform apply` a
couple of minutes later, you will have a plain Magento 2 Instance
running in AWS.

The technologies that are used in this guide are mostly open source or
free of charge. In order to follow this guide, you might need to setup
an account for gitlab and AWS.

Due to the use of terraform as an Abstraction for the AWS Console, you
will be able to run many services of AWS with just one command.
Depending on the different instance types of AWS, you might be charge
an enormous amount of money. Every code example that is published in
this guide will reference the instance type that is low of cost. The
specific code samples will also include comments for those instance
types that are recommended to use for Magento 2.

This guide doesn't cover a local development setup. It will reference
to the yet existing guides for terraform and Magento. If you are
struggling with the setup of individual technologies, make sure you get
help in their repositories.
